COMP801 – WEEK 2 – EXERCISES  
 
OBJECTIVES  
 Able to get user inputs 
 Able to use basic control structures 
o one-way selection (if)  
o two-way selection (if….else) 
 Able to use while and for loop 
 
USEFUL FUNCTIONS:  
 len (x)  : get the length of variable x 
 input() : get inputs from user 
 split() : to split a string into a list  
 split(separator):  separator is optional and is used when the separator is not a 
whitespace  
 
 
QUESTIONS:  
For each of the following questions, you have to write a python code, run it, and check your answer. 
 
1) What is the result of  the following code ? And what are the different between line 
(1) and (2)  
print(“Please enter your first name: ") 
firstName = input() length = len(firstName) print(firstName) print(“My first name is: ", firstName) (1)

print("My first name is: " + firstName) (2) 
print("My first name has",length,“characters.") 
2) What is the output of the following code ? 
fullName = “Ngoc LE" dob = “27/02/2023" nameList = fullName.split() dobList = dob.split(“/") print(“Words in my full name: ", nameList) print(“elements in my date of birth: ", dobList) print("My first name is:", nameArr[0]) print("My year of birth is:", dobArr[2]) 
3) Write a program to get user details (full name, date of birth) and print out the 
inputs as below (the text in red is dependent on the user inputs)  
My full name is: Ngoc LE My date of birth is: 27-02-2023  My last name is: LE My month of birth is: 02 
4) What is the result of the code below?  
x = 5 if(x>0):     print(x, "is a positive number.")

if(x<0): 
    print(x, "is a negative number.") if (x==0):     print(x, "is zero.") 
5) Write a program to ask a user to enter a number and check if the input number is 
zero or negative or positive. Your code should produce a result similar with the 
following example (the text in red is dependent on the user inputs).  
Please enter a number: 34 
34 is an even number 
6) Write a program to print out the following results  using (the text in red is 
dependent on the user inputs).  
Please enter a number: 7 The list includes:  
7 5 3 1 
7) What is the result of the following code?  
x = “4" 
intVal = int(x) 
for i in range (0, intVal):  print(i, end = “ ")

8) Write a program to print out the following results (the text in red is dependent on 
the user inputs).  
Please enter a number: 5 
Sum of integer numbers from 1 to 5 is 15 
9) Write a program to print out the following results (the text in red is dependent on 
the user inputs).  
Please enter a number: 5 
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 
10) Write a program to print out the following results (the text in red is dependent on 
the user inputs).  
Please enter a number: 5 
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 
11) Write a program to print out integer numbers from 1 to 100 those are divisible by 
3. 
12) Write a program to print out the sum of even numbe rs from 1 to 100. 
13) Write a program to print out integer numbers from 99 to 1 those are divisible by 7.
